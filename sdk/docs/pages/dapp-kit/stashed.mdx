# Stashed Integration

dApp Kit provides out-of-the-box opt-in support for the [Stashed wallet](../zksend/dapp.mdx).

## Setup

The stashed wallet will be enabled by default, using the windows title as the name of the app. To
customize the name of your app when connecting to a stashed wallet, you can pass options to the
`stashedWallet` prop of the `WalletProvider`. This object has the following properties:

- **`name`** - The name of your dApp, shown to the user when connecting to the dApp.

```tsx
function App({ children }) {
	return (
		<WalletProvider
			stashedWallet={{
				name: 'Your dApp name',
			}}
		>
			{children}
		</WalletProvider>
	);
}
```
